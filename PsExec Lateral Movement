PsExec Lateral Movement Log Analysis

Summary
This analysis examines network logs revealing a lateral movement technique using PsExec over SMB, a common method employed by attackers post-compromise to execute remote commands across a network. The findings demonstrate expertise in network traffic analysis, threat identification, and mitigation strategies, aligning with cybersecurity best practices.

The sequence of events, derived from packet analysis, is as follows:

Frames 126–129: Malicious activity begins with a TCP handshake and SMB negotiation.
Frames 130–133: NTLM authentication occurs, establishing credentials.
Frames 134–135: The attacker initiates lateral movement via a Tree Connect to IPC$, a prerequisite for administrative tasks.
Frames 136–137: Interface query to gather network context.
Frames 138–143: Access to ADMIN$ share, followed by file creation actions.
Frames 144–146: Creation of PSEXESVC.exe, confirming PsExec execution.

Context
PsExec and PSEXESVC.exe
PSEXESVC.exe is a temporary service binary used by PsExec, a legitimate Sysinternals tool for remote command execution. Attackers exploit it to create services on victim machines, enabling lateral movement during post-compromise phases.
NTLM Authentication
NTLM is a legacy Microsoft authentication protocol using a challenge-response mechanism. Its lack of mutual authentication and weak cryptography makes it vulnerable to exploitation compared to modern protocols like Kerberos.
Evidence
The following artifacts were extracted using NetworkMiner:

Files Recovered:
PSEXESVC.exe: Remote execution service binary.
.key files: Associated with PsExec operations.

Network Details:
Source IP: 10.0.0.130
Destination IP: 10.0.0.131
Protocol: SMB2

Analysis

NTLM Vulnerability: The use of NTLM facilitated the exploit due to its lack of mutual authentication and weak cryptography, unlike newer protocols.
Authentication and Privilege Escalation: NTLM authentication from 10.0.0.130 using the \ssales account was immediately followed by access to administrative shares, indicating privileged operations.
PsExec Confirmation: The creation of PSEXESVC.exe confirms PsExec-driven remote code execution.
Timing: All actions occurred within a ~40ms window, suggesting automated exploitation.
MITRE ATT&CK Alignment: The sequence of SMB commands and PSEXESVC.exe creation aligns with T1021.002 (Remote Services: SMB/Windows Admin Shares).

Conclusion
This analysis provides strong evidence of lateral movement and remote code execution via PsExec over SMB, a technique commonly used in post-exploitation phases. The findings highlight the need for immediate investigation and mitigation to prevent further compromise.
Recommendations

Block SMB Traffic: Restrict unnecessary SMB traffic
Enforce Stronger Authentication: Transition from NTLM to Kerberos to mitigate authentication vulnerabilities.
Monitor Administrative Shares: Implement alerts for unauthorized access to ADMIN$ or IPC$ shares.
Investigate Suspect IP: Conduct a forensic analysis of 10.0.0.130 to identify the attack source.
Enhance Detection: Deploy intrusion detection systems (IDS) to flag PsExec-related anomalies.

Tools and Techniques

Wireshark, NetworkMiner
MITRE ATT&CK Framework: Applied to contextualize the attack technique.

Next Steps

Implement recommended mitigations and monitor their effectiveness.
Conduct a broader network audit to detect similar activities.
