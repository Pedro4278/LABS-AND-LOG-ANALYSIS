PsExec Lateral Movement Log Analysis

Summary
This analysis examines network logs revealing a lateral movement technique using PsExec over SMB, a common method employed by attackers post-compromise to execute remote commands across a network. The findings demonstrate expertise in network traffic analysis, threat identification, and mitigation strategies, aligning with cybersecurity best practices.

Timeline of Events
The sequence of events, derived from packet analysis, is as follows:

Frames 126–129: Malicious activity begins with a TCP handshake and SMB negotiation.
Frames 130–133: NTLM authentication occurs, establishing credentials.
Frames 134–135: The attacker initiates lateral movement via a Tree Connect to IPC$, a prerequisite for administrative tasks.
Frames 136–137: Interface query to gather network context.
Frames 138–143: Access to ADMIN$ share, followed by file creation actions.
Frames 144–146: Creation of PSEXESVC.exe, confirming PsExec execution.

Context
PsExec and PSEXESVC.exe
PSEXESVC.exe is a temporary service binary used by PsExec, a legitimate Sysinternals tool for remote command execution. Attackers exploit it to create services on victim machines, enabling lateral movement during post-compromise phases.
NTLM Authentication
NTLM is a legacy Microsoft authentication protocol using a challenge-response mechanism. Its lack of mutual authentication and weak cryptography makes it vulnerable to exploitation compared to modern protocols like Kerberos.
Evidence
The following artifacts were extracted using NetworkMiner:

Files Recovered:
PSEXESVC.exe: Remote execution service binary.
.key files: Associated with PsExec operations.

Network Details:
Source IP: 10.0.0.130
Destination IP: 10.0.0.131
Protocol: SMB2

Analysis

NTLM Vulnerability: The use of NTLM facilitated the exploit due to its lack of mutual authentication and weak cryptography, unlike newer protocols.
Authentication and Privilege Escalation: NTLM authentication from 10.0.0.130 using the \ssales account was immediately followed by access to administrative shares, indicating privileged operations.
PsExec Confirmation: The creation of PSEXESVC.exe confirms PsExec-driven remote code execution.
Timing: All actions occurred within a ~40ms window, suggesting automated exploitation.
MITRE ATT&CK Alignment: The sequence of SMB commands and PSEXESVC.exe creation aligns with T1021.002 (Remote Services: SMB/Windows Admin Shares).

Conclusion
This analysis provides strong evidence of lateral movement and remote code execution via PsExec over SMB, a technique commonly used in post-exploitation phases. The findings highlight the need for immediate investigation and mitigation to prevent further compromise.
Recommendations

Block SMB Traffic: Restrict unnecessary SMB traffic
Enforce Stronger Authentication: Transition from NTLM to Kerberos to mitigate authentication vulnerabilities.
Monitor Administrative Shares: Implement alerts for unauthorized access to ADMIN$ or IPC$ shares.
Investigate Suspect IP: Conduct a forensic analysis of 10.0.0.130 to identify the attack source.
Enhance Detection: Deploy intrusion detection systems (IDS) to flag PsExec-related anomalies.

Tools and Techniques

Wireshark, NetworkMiner
MITRE ATT&CK Framework: Applied to contextualize the attack technique.

Next Steps

Implement recommended mitigations and monitor their effectiveness.
Conduct a broader network audit to detect similar activities.
